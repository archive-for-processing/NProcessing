# What It Is
NProcessing is a partial port of [Processing](https://processing.org/) to the .NET/C# world.
Simple Processing scripts should port easily and run fine. A porting guide is included

# Bonus Stuff
This project contains a bunch of components that are either recycled or created for this. Most could be stripped out for subsequent reuse.

- A theoretically better multimedia timer with improved accuracy for sub 10 msec period.
- Multiple file change watcher.
- General purpose embedded C# in memory compiler.

# Third Party
This application uses these excellent FOSS components:

- SkiaSharp for graphics: [SkiaSharp](https://github.com/mono/SkiaSharp) (MIT). Waaaay faster than native GDI+.
- Logging: [NLog](http://nlog-project.org/) (BSD 3-Clause).
- [MoreLinq](https://morelinq.github.io) (MIT).
- Markdown processing: [Markdig](https://github.com/lunet-io/markdig) (BSD 2-Clause)
- Json processor: [Newtonsoft](https://github.com/JamesNK/Newtonsoft.Json) (MIT) Note - uses 9.0.1 - don't update!
